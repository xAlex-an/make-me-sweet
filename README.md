## User Experience (UX)

### Agile Methodology  

#### User Stories  
User stories were created to define how users and admins interact with the recipe blog.  
Each story describes a specific goal and its benefit:  

- As a **Site Admin**, I can create, read, update, and delete recipe posts so that I can fully manage the blog content.
- As a **Site Admin**, I can create draft recipes so that I can finish them later.  
- As a **Site Admin**, I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable ones.  
- As a **Site User**, I can register an account so that I can comment on recipes.  
- As a **Site User**, I can leave, edit, and delete my own comments so that I can join the conversation.  
- As a **Site User**, I can view a paginated list of recipes so that I can browse them easily.  
- As a **Site User**, I can click on a recipe to view its full details.  
- As a **Site User**, I can open the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page to read about the author.  
- As a **Site User**, I can submit recipe suggestions so that the author can consider them in the future.  
- As a **Site Owner**, I can store and manage submitted recipe ideas so that I can review them later.  

![User Stories Kanban Board](docs/screenshots/kanban.png)
*User Stories organized in GitHub Projects Kanban board*

#### Milestones  
To organize development, the project was divided into milestones.  
Each milestone groups related features and issues tracked on the GitHub Kanban board.  

1. **Project Requirements Release** ‚Äì All must-have features required to complete the project  
   - CRUD recipes  
   - Pagination  
   - Recipe details  
   - User registration & login  
   - User comments (add, manage, view)  

2. **Admin Features** ‚Äì Extended functionality for the site admin  
   - Draft recipes  
   - Comment approval  
   - Manage About page  
   - Store recipe suggestions  

3. **Additional Pages & Enhancements** ‚Äì Extra features beyond the requirements  
   - View About page (author info)  
   - Submit recipe ideas  

---

#### Project Board  
All user stories are tracked and managed on a Kanban board in GitHub Projects.  
The board is divided into **Backlog, Todo, In Progress, and Done**, showing the progress of each issue.  

![Kanban Board](docs/screenshots/kanban_board.png)
*GitHub Projects Kanban board showing user stories and development progress*

üîó **Link to the user stories kanban board:** [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/xAlex-an/projects/13)

![Project Milestones](docs/screenshots/milestone_1.png)
*Project milestones and sprint planning overview*  

#### MoSCoW Prioritization  
The **MoSCoW prioritization method** was applied to classify tasks into importance categories using custom labels inside GitHub Issues.  
This ensured the most critical features were developed first, while less critical ones were planned for later iterations.  

- **Must Have** ‚Äì Core features that are essential for the recipe blog to function and for the project to be successfully delivered.  
- **Should Have** ‚Äì Important features that add value and improve usability but are not required for the initial launch.  
- **Could Have** ‚Äì Optional enhancements that would provide a better user experience but can be implemented later.  
- **Won‚Äôt Have** ‚Äì Features that are intentionally excluded from the current development cycle but may be considered in the future (e.g., Save Favorite Recipes).  

This Agile-inspired approach made it possible to:  
- Break down the recipe blog requirements into smaller, actionable user stories (e.g., CRUD recipes, user comments, About page).  
- Prioritize features using MoSCoW labels, ensuring that essential recipe management and commenting were delivered first.  
- Track development transparently in a GitHub Kanban board, showing progress on tasks like recipe CRUD, pagination, and user registration.  
- Deliver the project in logical phases using milestones (Project Requirements Release, Admin Features, Additional Enhancements). 
## Database Design  

The database schema was designed to support recipes, users, and comments with clear relationships.  
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created in **Lucidchart (lucid.app)** to visualise the structure.  

![Entity-Relationship Diagram](docs/screenshots/erd_model.png)
*Database schema showing relationships between User, Recipe, and Comment models*  

### Entities  

**User**  
- `id` (PK) ‚Äî unique identifier  
- `username` ‚Äî text field  
- `password` ‚Äî hashed password field  

**Recipe**  
- `id` (PK) ‚Äî unique identifier  
- `title` ‚Äî recipe title  
- `slug` ‚Äî unique slug for clean URLs  
- `author` (FK) ‚Äî relation to User model  
- `featured_image` ‚Äî Cloudinary image field  
- `description` ‚Äî short text introduction  
- `ingredients` ‚Äî list of ingredients  
- `instructions` ‚Äî detailed preparation steps  
- `excerpt` ‚Äî short preview text
- `tag` ‚Äî optional label used to highlight recipe themes or categories
- `status` ‚Äî integer field (e.g., draft, published)  
- `created_on` ‚Äî datetime of creation  
- `updated_on` ‚Äî datetime of last update  

**Comment**  
- `id` (PK) ‚Äî unique identifier  
- `recipe` (FK) ‚Äî linked to Recipe  
- `author` (FK) ‚Äî linked to User  
- `body` ‚Äî comment text  
- `approved` ‚Äî boolean (approved by admin or not)  
- `created_on` ‚Äî datetime of creation  

### Relationships  
- A **User** can create many **Recipes**.  
- A **Recipe** belongs to one **User** (author).  
- A **User** can leave many **Comments**.  
- A **Recipe** can have many **Comments**.  
- Each **Comment** is tied to both a **User** (author of comment) and a **Recipe**.  

This structure ensures that:  
- Recipes are fully manageable by the author/admin.  
- Comments can be moderated using the `approved` field.  
- Users can interact with recipes in a structured, relational way.

#### üåê HTML Validation via Live URL

Since the project uses Django Template Language (DTL), direct validation of .html template files was not possible. Instead, the final rendered markup was validated using the W3C Markup Validator via the deployed site:

**Validation performed using the live site:** https://make-me-sweet-f649b0b1112e.herokuapp.com/

![Live URL Validation](docs/screenshots/url_markup.png)
*W3C Markup Validator results using the live deployed site URL*

This method ensured that the actual output ‚Äî including dynamic content ‚Äî was fully compliant with HTML5 standards.

#### HTML Validation Before & After

**Before Fixes - Validation Errors Detected:**

![HTML Validation Errors](docs/screenshots/markup_errors.png)
*Nu Html Checker showing markup errors that needed to be resolved*

**After Fixes - Validation Pass:**

![HTML Validation Success](docs/screenshots/markup.png)
*Nu Html Checker confirming all markup errors have been resolved*

#### Resolved HTML Validation Issues

**1. Meta Viewport Trailing Slash (Info)**
```html
<!-- Before (with trailing slash) -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

<!-- After (HTML5 compliant) -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
- **Issue:** Trailing slash on void elements not required in HTML5
- **Impact:** Better HTML5 compliance and consistency
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**2. Section Accessibility Heading (Warning)**
```html
<!-- Before (nested heading) -->
<section id="about" class="about-me py-5">
  <div class="container">
    <article class="row align-items-center">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="about-content">
          <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

<!-- After (proper section structure) -->
<section id="about" class="about-me py-5">
  <div class="container">
    <header>
      <h2 class="section-title text-center mb-4">About Me</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="row align-items-center">
```
- **Issue:** Section lacked proper heading structure for accessibility
- **Impact:** Better screen reader navigation and WCAG compliance
